# green_card_citations_list
Creates a list of all papers citing an author's papers based on his/her Google Scholar profile. This document is useful for the Green Card EB1B application.

This is a Python 3 Jupyter notebook. It requires Google Chrome, a Google Scholar profile and a few Python packages that can be installed from the command line using pip:

pip install pdfkit
pip install wkhtmltopdf
pip install selenium
pip install PyPDF2

# Check version of google chrome in Chrome->About Google Chrome (update if necessary)
pip install chromedriver-binary==97.0.4692.71

In the script you'll need to edit the link to the Google Scholar profile and the Google Chrome downloads folder. This script was tested on macOS Big Sur Version 11.5 with Python 3.8.8.
